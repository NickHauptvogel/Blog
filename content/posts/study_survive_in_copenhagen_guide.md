![A guide to survive in Copenhagen!](/static/copenhagen_guide.jpg)


## Introduction

In August 2022, I moved from my hometown Bremen in Germany to Copenhangen, 
Denmark, in order to start my Master's Degree studies in Computer Science at
the University of Copenhagen. After finishing my B.Sc. Degree in Computer 
Engineering in 2021, the strive for international experience and an continuation 
in the academic research environment led me to the decision to perform my 
Master's degree abroad.

Early on, I started with the preparation of my stay abroad and gathered 
information about administrative tasks, but also student life advices. For 
that, I used several different sources, but soon found the information 
landscape to be quite scarce. In order to facilitate the process of starting 
the study life in Denmark for following students, I have decided to write a
(hopefully) comprehensive and complete guide to studying and surviving as a
foreign student in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Please bear in mind that many of the described processes only apply to EU 
citizens (and some also relate to the University of Copenhagen) and might be 
different for Non-EU students or other universities. Also, processes might
change in the future, in which case they can deviate from the following 
descriptions. But now enough of the disclaimer, let us start with the guide!

## Before Moving to Denmark

### Residence Permit

There are a couple of (mostly administrative) tasks that one can initiate before
moving to Denmark. First and foremost, the residence permit application process
can be started before moving to the country. For that, the University of 
Copenhagen sends an invitation containing a link to the application portal.
After receiving the e-mail and clicking on the link, follow the instructions in 
the application process and fill out the so-called "OD1" form online.

In the process, there are different documents that need to be uploaded. The
Declaration of Self-Support is not required to be signed beforehand, so you can
just download and upload the same document again. Second, the Declaration of
study activity is superfluous if you have already received your admission
letter from the university. In that case, just upload the letter of admission 
instead. Third, the sworn declaration needs to be downloaded, signed (also
digitally) and then re-uploaded.

It is possible for the residence permit to apply without an address in Denmark 
yet. In that case, just insert your home address, your Danish address 
will be then requested afterwards.

At the end of the process, you have to book an appointment at SIRI (Styrelsen 
for International Rekruttering og Integration) to finish the process. For that,
it is important to book the appointment via the link in the e-mail, **not** 
via the link at the end of the OD1 form fill out! When choosing the link from 
the mail, it is possible to choose a special opening day of the administration
office only for students, on which you receive the residence permit on the same
day. After having booked the appointment, note down the booking number. It is 
the number you have to enter at the entrance of the administration office.
